# Pintos
Labs for undergraduate OS class honor track at Peking University. [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) 
is a teaching operating system for x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run x86 machine and simulators 
including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments 
are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).

## Acknowledgement
This code source is adapted from professor ([Ryan Huang](huang@cs.jhu.edu)) at JHU, who also taught a undergraduate OS class. He made some changes to the original
Pintos labs (add lab0 and fix some bugs for MacOS). The upstream for this branch comes from 
https://github.com/ryanphuang/PintosM.git. For students in the class, please
download the release version for this branch at git@github.com:PKU-OS/pintos.git.
